## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media Querys

### What I learned

I learned how to use the **color-mix()** function to create colors from others and also practiced using the html *picture* element

### Useful resources

- [CSS color-mix](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/blog/color-palettes-css-color-mix/) - It helped me a lot to understand how the color mixing function works.
